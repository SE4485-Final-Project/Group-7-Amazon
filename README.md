# Intelligent Service Requests Resolver Framework

## Project Description:

This project is the final project in the University of Texas at Dallas' Software Engineering degree plan. Collabarating with Amazon within the SE4485 our team shall develop an Intelligent Service Requests Resolver Framework.

Purpose and Scope of the plan
The purpose of this plan is to provide structure and guidance to the development of the Intelligent Service Requests Resolver Framework
The scope of this plan covers a 16-week semester time period to develop a working framework that can resolve service requests without the need for human interaction, and that can be applied to multiple domains.
An API AWS server that handles requests from multiple sources (Email, Client, Standalone) and returns information based on the examples below. A user input will be taken under consideration to eva	luate the ML model in a repeated cycle.

Brief overview of the product (including purpose, capabilities, scenarios for using the product, etc)
Purpose - resolve service requests independently using machine learning techniques, reduce the need for human interaction
Capabilities - extensible and configurable, automatically resolve service requests, produce and analyze reports in real time, scalable
Scenarios - “Can you train me how to use this projector?” – Please refer to below links for how-to-guide
